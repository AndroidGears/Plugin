## Android Gears - Android Studio Plugin

Android Gears is a new <b>dependency management system</b> built on open source technology through Github. It is meant as an alternative to Maven and integrates fully with the Gradle build processes of Android Studio and IntelliJ. In addition to providing a robust search interface for library discovery, Gears greatly reduces the effort it takes to share your library with others. Listing your library with Android Gears is just a pull request away.
